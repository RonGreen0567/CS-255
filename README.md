Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project was for a client named Liam who owned a driving instruction company called DriverPass. The client wanted a comprehensive online system that would allow students to schedule driving lessons, access practice tests and learning materials, and track their progress, while enabling administrators to manage users and services. The system was designed to bridge the gap between driver education and DMV testing requirements.

What did you do particularly well?

I was determined to finish up the course and make sure everything got turned in on time no matter what happend.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would revies the system design document due to the feedback given to me about how my Use Case Diagram is actually an incorrectly-formatted Activity Diagram.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The way I interpreted the user's needs was by putting myself in their shoes to make sure I understood what would be better or worse for the user and always have the mindset of being a user. Its crucial to consider the user's needs when designing due to the user being the one to use the system constantly so it needs to be built around the users to keep them coming back to use the system.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

planning and requirements are a very big starting point so you understand where your trying to get to with the software. Designing the system to be easly changeable in the future to allow easy maintance. Detailed Componants to make sure everything will run smoothly for the implementation. followed by testing and deployment.
